# Greetings, digital explorer!

Embark on a pixelated journey inspired by Tony Halik, the real-life Polish explorer and filmmaker whose adventures spanned continents and decades. From flying in the RAF during the Second World War to exploring ancient civilisations for NBC, Tony's love of discovery knew no bounds. Now it's your turn to step into Tony's digital shoes and unravel the mysteries of Montezuma's Castle in this nostalgic 8-bit homage.
System Requirements:

* A trusty Commodore 64 or reliable emulator.
* A sense of retro adventure, fired up and ready to go.
* A joystick plugged into port 2. (Trust us, that's where all the action is).

# Game overview:

As Tony, you'll traverse the pixel art of Montezuma's Castle. Watch out for those tricky traps, avoid pixelated dangers and let chiptune rhythms guide your path.
Controls & Commands:

* Joystick left/right: Standard movement.
* Up/Down on joystick: Navigate through ladders.

# Tips from an earlier explorer:

Legend has it that Montezuma's Mask is more than just an artefact. Find it, and you may reveal more than its shiny surface. The door to something monumental awaits you!
